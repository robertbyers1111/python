1. spent several hours unable to run Popen because one of the args passed in was read from a file without using strip():

    f = open(LOCKFILE, 'r')
    for line in f:
      if line.strip() != "":
        pidval = line.strip()       <---- MUST USE THE '.strip()'
    f.close()

    if pidval == 0:
      WARN("Failed to find valid pid in lockfile")
      deletelockfile = True

    else:
      INFO("pid from lockfile:",pidval)
      child = sp.Popen( ['/bin/ps', '--no-headers', '-opid', '-p%s' % pidval], shell=False, stdout=sp.PIPE, stderr=sp.PIPE)

If I don't use the '.strip()', then the call to /bin/ps chokes on the pidval variable.
