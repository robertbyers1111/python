# When a module named spam is imported, the interpreter first searches
# for a built-in module with that name. If not found, it then searches
# for a file named spam.py in a list of directories given by the
# variable sys.path. sys.path is initialized from these locations:
#
#   + The directory containing the input script (or the current directory
#     when no file is specified).
#
#   + PYTHONPATH (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the
#     shell variable PATH).
#
#   + The installation-dependent default.
